# Global Properties and Galaxy Correlations

## Spectra

* Early type galaxies have redder spectra and deeper absorption features
* Later-type galaxies have spectra that are dominated by emission from hot stars

## General Trends

* Late Type Galaxies:
    * High star formation rate
    * High gas fraction
    * High rotational support
    * Higher gas-phase metallicity

* Early type galaxies
    * Mass is higher
    * Environment is more complicated
    * Mass surface density higher
    * Metallicity higher


## Synethic Spectra

* Note that spectra vary much more with age than metallicity, and the two quantities are degenerate. 

### with Age

* For the same stellar mass population, younger populations are bluer and more luminous per unit mass.

### with Metallicity

* For a fixed mass and galaxy type, **lower metallicites are bluer and brighter. This is due to opacity. Higher metallicities give higher opacity, and thus we have less light at bluer wavelenghts.**

## K Corrections

* SEDs change with reedshift. Ultimately, we want to measure the rest frame color $u-r$ value, but we need to correct for both expansion and distance.
* Due to redshift effects, both the wavelength and bandpasses change! 
* Looking at higher z galaxies in the same filter, we receive emission from shorter wavelengths at a slower rate.

m = M + \mu + K

* You need to assume that you know the intrinsic spectrum shape, though. 


## Stellar Mass-Color Relation

* Redder galaxies have larger mass-to-light ratios. The redder the band you observe, the less sensitive the inferred mass to light is with color
* **There is no one-to-one mapping between mass and luminosity. You need a color measurement as well. The redder bands are better since the spectrum is less dominated by single, hot stars.**
    * If you want age measurements though, you should go to bluer wavelengths.

## Color Sequences

* The color of a galaxy is really the slope of the SED. Measuring a galaxy color allows us to measure the mass-to-light ratio. 
* We see two groups of galaxies when we plot color versus mass:
    * Early type galaxies span 2 dex in mass but hardly change color
    * The color slope for early type galaxies is driven primarily by metallicity
    * The color slope for late-type galaxies is driven by star formation properties (dominant over dust effects)

## 4000 Angstrom Decrement

* Another interesting way to classify galaxies is by looking just before and just after 4000 angstroms. 
* Lots of age sensitive features in the spectrum here, allowing us to make this plot;
