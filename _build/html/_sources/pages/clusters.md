# Clusters and Groups of Galaxies

## Properties of Clusters

* **Largest virialized structures in the Universe**
* **Richness criterion:** at least 50 members with apparent magnitude $m < m_3 +2$ (with $m_3$ the magnitude of the third brightest cluster member)
    * Richness = # of galaxies between $m_3$ and $m_3 + 2$ 
* **Compactness criterion:** only members with distances < 1.5 $h^{-1}$ Mpc
* **Typical sizes:** 1-3 Mpc

* The richest clusters are typically found at intersections of filaments in the Cosmic Web
* Roughly $1-2$ % of galaxies are in rich clusters
* Up to 10% are in clusters at al
* The majority of galaxies are in "groups" 

## Ingredients of a Cluster

* **Galaxies**
    * $\sim 100$ large galaxies, $> 10^{3}$ total galaxies
    * Typical speeds of $1000$ km/s
* **Intra-cluster Stars**
    * Very faint, but comprises of $10-50$% of the total cluster light
* **Hot gas**
    * Hydrostatic atmosphere of clusters
    * $T\sim 10^{7-8}$ K → very hot x-ray emitters
    * $M_{gas} \sim 5 \times M_{gal}$ with $Z \sim 0.3 Z_{sol}$ 
* **Dark matter**
    * Absolutely dominates the total mass

## Identification of Clusters


* Fingers of God: In redshift space, large peculiar velocities make clusters appear as elongated stuctures
* Quiescent galaxies in clusters have roughly the same colors (same redshift and roughly the same age), so if we see a ton of red galaxies in the same color, they're likely in a cluster
* At high $z$, we cannot use the red sequence method since galaxies are still forming stars and spectroscopic redshifts are difficult to obtain
    * Instead we use intermediate band filters to measure more accurate photometric redshifts (basically photo-z from SEDs)

## Relevant Physical Proceses in Clusters

* **Tidal stripping** happens when the tidal forces from a neighboring object overcomes the gravitational force holding the object together
* **Galaxy harassment** refers to the accumulated effect of multiple gravitational interactions, both galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-cluster
* **Ram pressure stripping** by hot cluster gas, removes cold gas from galaxies
* **Major mergers** are less common in galaxy clusters because of the large velocity dispersions $\sigma \sim 1000$ km/s

## Cluster Galaxy Population 

* There's typically a radial gradient in galaxy type, with more early type galaxies at the center and spirals/irregulars in the outskirts
* **Butcher-Oemler Effect**: Fraction of blue galaxies in clusters increases with redshift
    * Fraction of spirals, star formation increases with redshift, 
    * Galaxy populatios evolve rapidly in clusters, primarily due to environmental effects

### Brightest Cluster Galaxies

* Brightest galaxies in cluster, with essentially zero velocity relative to the cluster mean
* $\sim 10L_\star$ galaxies, 50-100 kpc in scale
* Also called cD galaxies, extended haloes of stars, many of which are radio galaxies
* Multiple nuclei are often observed, and they're quite successful at eating their neighbors
* They **do not follow** the luminosity function of galaxies
    * They also have lower velocity dispersions for their magnitude/mass than you'd predict from Faber-Jackson relation




## Hot Gas in Clusters

* Cluster halos retain a hot, gaseous atmosphere
    * They're the most luminous, extended X-ray sources, with $L_x \sim 10^{43}$ to $10^{46}$ ergs/s
    * Gas is really hot, $T\sim 10^{7}$ to $10^{8}$ K, likely heated by infall into the deep halo potential
* Gas radiates in X-rays via free-free radiation (thermal bremsstrahlung) – basically electrons are accelerated in the electric field of other particles and radiate
* Gas masses that range from $M_{gas} \sim M_{stars}$ to $M_{gas} \sim 7 M_{stars}$ (**more massive clusters have higher gas fractions**)
   
* Gas Accretion
    * Some gas falling into dark matter halo shocks to the virial temperature and reaches (quasi-) hydrostatic equilibrium (hot accretion)
    * The rest of the gas falls in along cold streams (cold accretion)
    * Hot accretion is more dominant in massive halos and at low redshift
