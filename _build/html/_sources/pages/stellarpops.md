## Stellar Evolution Review

* Stars spend most of their life on the MS, defined as hydrogen core burning. 
    * Thus, there is a unique radius for each star along the main sequence. We infer a readius via the Stefan-Boltzmann law. We measure a luminosity $L=4\pi F d^2$ and temperature from spectra or colors: $L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4$. 
    * On the MS, $L\sim M^{3.5}$ or so. 
    * More massive stars are in the upper-left, less massive in the bottom right. Radius increase upward and rightward.
    * Main sequence stars are chemically homogeneous and are in hydrostatic equilibrium.
    * **Energy Transport**
        * Low mass stars have convective exteriors, whereas high mass stars have convection in the core. 
    * **Chemical Composition**
        * For the same mass, higher metallicity stars have slightly lower $T$ and $L$. 
        * Pop I stars: Relatively rich in heavy elements
        * Pop II stars: Relatively poor in heavy elements
        * Pop III: Metal free

* Post Main Sequence Evolution
    * Hydrogen stops burning, but temperature is not hot enough for He burning. Thus the core contracts and heats. Outer hydrogen burning begins. 
    * Core continues to contract until H burns furiously. Luminosity increases rapidly and you have lots of mass loss. Core contracts as more Helium is dumped to the core. 
    * H shell burning continues until $10^{8}$ K, at which point Helium can start burning and the He flash occurs giving huge burst of energy. 
    * Core expands, gravity weakens, and energy production decreases. 
    * Star settles onto the Horizontal branch, characterized by He core burning and H shell burning via CNO cycle. 
    * After you establish a CO core, you can't burn, and the core contracts and heats. Stars move up the asymoptotic giant branch, experiencing significant mass loss.
