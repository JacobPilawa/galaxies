# The Milky Way

## Components

* Disk
    * $M_\star \sim 6 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ 
    * Cold gas mass is $5\times 10^{10} M_\odot$ 
        * 20% is H2 and associated with star formation
        * 80% of gas is HI and often thought of as reservoirs for **future** star formation
    * Youngest stars are about a million years old
    * Radial metallicity gradient 
* Thin Disk
    * $M_\star \sim 5\times 10^{10} M_\odot$
    * Radial scale height of 0.3 kpc, vertical scale height of 0.3 kpc
    * Mixed aged populatiion
* Thick Disk
* Dark Matter Halo
    * Virial radius of about 150 kpc
    * $M_{DM} \sim 10^{12} M_\odot$
