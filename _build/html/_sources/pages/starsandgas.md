# Star and Gas Formation

## Star Formation in the Local Universe

* Roughly 25% of local star formation happens in **starburst** galaxies, which have SFR of a few to $1000$ $M_\odot$ per year. 
* The other 75% of star formation takes place in normal spiral galaxies with $0$ to a few solar masses per year. 
* Star formation takes place in **giant molecular clouds**, with masses of 100,000 to a million solar masses. 
    * These extend over a few tens of parsecs, and are typically cold with $T \sim 10$ K. 
    * Star formation is an inefficient process, needing $\sim 10 M_\odot$ of gas for every solar mass formed.

### Jeans Mass and Cloud Fragmentation

* The free-fall timescale is given by $t\sim (G\rho)^{-1/2}$, whereas the 
* timescale for pressure is the sound crossing time: $t \sim R/v_s$. 
* Gravity wins when the free-fall time scale is shorter than the pressure timescale:

$$
R > \sqrt{\frac{v_s^2}{G\rho}}
$$

And the Jeans mass is simply the mass contained inside a sphere of the Jeans length.


## Star Formation Rate Indicators

* Fundamental question: My galaxy has massive stars that I cannot necessarily observe. Can we find indicators for ongoing star formation?
* A really excellent page is [here](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept12/Calzetti/Calzetti1_2.html).

### UV Emission

* UV is really great for massive stars greater than about $M>3 M_\odot$. These are MS stars with $T> 10,000$K or so, and lifetimes of 10-100 Million years.
* We can use this emission (corrected for dust with a $\beta$ slope) to estimate the SFR of a galaxy. 
* This is because O and B stars set the UV slope, and these are sensitive to recent star formation. 
* Assumptions:
    * Correct for $\beta$ slope
    * Need to assume an IMF
    * Then you can use the **Kennicutt SFR relations:**
        * SFR $\propto L_\nu$ where $\nu$ is over the UV continuum.

### Recombination Lines

* Balmer emission lines lower $n=2$ state originate from HII regions and from stellar atmospheres. 
* Only really massive stars $M>15M_\odot$ can actually ionize the surrounding medium. 
* The continuum will be set by the stars, but the emission lines are only from the most massive ones.
* **We are incredibly sensitive to the IMF choice since we need the most massive stars for H$\alpha$ for example.**
* Assumptions:
    * Assume a metallicty
    * Assume dust correction
    * Assume we know the IMF
    * Binarity

### Far IR Emission

* Far IR emission $(>10 \mu m$ or so) comes mostly from attenuated UV light from massive stars and serves as a SFR indicator. 
* We need to combine the UV and FIR SFRs and can convert total IR luminosities to SFRs. 


### X-ray Emission

* High mass x-ray binaries have a very short lifetime (~20 million years) and their X-ray luminosity can thus serve as SFR indicators


### Radio Emission

* Free-free emission from relativistic electrons dominates spectra near 100 GHz as long as it can be disentangled from cold dust emission. 
* Hydrogen gets ionized from massive stars and radio recombination lines cascade. 
* This portion of the spectrum is free of dust effects and thus is a gold standard for SFR indicators. It comes without dust and directly from HII regions. 
* ``This is understandable because massive star-formation activities like supernova explosions, their shocks, and remnants increase the number density of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons (CREs) and/or accelerate them, on one hand, and amplify the turbulent magnetic field strength, on the other hand. The net effect of these processes is a strong nonthermal emission in or around star-forming regions.''


## Molecular Gas in Galaxies

* Another way to trace star formation is to trace the amount of gas available in galaxies. 
* Star formation happens in H2 clouds, but these are notoriously hard to observe.
