# Star and Gas Formation

## Star Formation in the Local Universe

* Roughly 25% of local star formation happens in **starburst** galaxies, which have SFR of a few to $1000$ $M_\odot$ per year. 
* The other 75% of star formation takes place in normal spiral galaxies with $0$ to a few solar masses per year. 
* Star formation takes place in **giant molecular clouds**, with masses of 100,000 to a million solar masses. 
    * These extend over a few tens of parsecs, and are typically cold with $T \sim 10$ K. 
    * Star formation is an inefficient process, needing $\sim 10 M_\odot$ of gas for every solar mass formed.

### Jeans Mass and Cloud Fragmentation

* The free-fall timescale is given by $t\sim (G\rho)^{-1/2}$, whereas the 
* timescale for pressure is the sound crossing time: $t \sim R/v_s$. 
* Gravity wins when the free-fall time scale is shorter than the pressure timescale:

$$
R > \sqrt{\frac{v_s^2}{G\rho}}
$$

And the Jeans mass is simply the mass contained inside a sphere of the Jeans length.
